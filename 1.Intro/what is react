React JS is a javascript library for building User Interfaces.

React is component based framework.

Component is a reusbale code.

React uses two libraries.

1. React JS for developing Components

2. ReactDOM : for rendering react Components on real DOM.

ReactDOM is an object which contains render() method which is used to render a javscript function
as a component to real DOM.

syntax:

 ReactDOM.render(
     <react function as tag />,
     document.querySelector('#id');
 )

 React mostly uses next generation javascript syntax (features). So It uses Babel compiler for compiling next 
 generation JS code and runs on browser.



 React component function has props as a argument which reads the values dynamically 
 from ReactDOM.render() method.
