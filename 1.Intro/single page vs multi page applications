We can create two kinds of application with React.

1. Single Page Application.

  In SPA, user will get single HTML page from server when user first visits the website. There after everything
  is managed with Javascript with React. Entire page consists of components which are rendered and handled by Javascript.

  Content rendered on Client.

  In SPA , typically we have only one RenderDOM.render() call. and root app component is mounted to DOM which
  holds other react components.


2. Multi Page Application.

  In Multi Page Application, user will get multiple pages from Server.Each page has content for given route(URL)
  We mgiht use React but only to create little widgets which are individually contained components that we
  dumped into main page but not entire page is managed by React.

  Content rendered on Server.

    In Multi Page Application ,  we have  multiple RenderDOM.render() calls per each widget.
